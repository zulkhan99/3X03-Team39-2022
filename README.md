## How to run
Django is best run in a virtual environment, feel free to setup with the environment you are comfortable using
### Setup for pipenv

In the command prompt
```
pip install pipenv
```

cd to the repo directory
```
pipenv shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Place the .env file into the same directory as manage.py. This contains the django secret key

### Setup for web app
Once the requirements are installed, you will need to migrate the database models. We are using sqlite for now, will change in the future

make sure you are in the env `pipenv shell`
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create superuser
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once created, start the web app
```
python manage.py runserver
```

To create accounts for now, go to user management and use the django user management
